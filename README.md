# VAAD AI-0G Roadmap

Welcome to the visionary roadmap for **VAAD AI-0G**, an AI-powered DeFi and SocialFi trading assistant built on 0G’s Modular Layer 1 blockchain. This journey transforms cryptocurrency trading into a transparent, community-driven, and scalable experience, making AI a public good in Web3. Below, we outline our creative, iterative development plan across four waves, each building toward a robust, innovative dApp.

---

## Vision
VAAD AI-0G aims to empower traders with real-time insights, whale intelligence, and risk management, while fostering a decentralized social trading ecosystem. Leveraging 0G’s 0G Chain, Compute, Storage, and Data Availability (DA), we’re crafting a future where AI enhances every trade, validated onchain and shared globally.

## Roadmap Overview

### Wave 1: Ideation and Foundation Forge
 
**Objective**: Lay the groundwork with creative planning, a demo, and a solid foundation.  
**Illustration**: Imagine a blacksmith’s forge, where raw ideas are heated and shaped into a gleaming sword. The anvil represents our planning sessions, the hammer our demo strikes, and the sparks our innovative spirit.

- **Tasks**:
  - Brainstorm core features: real-time data, whale tracking, AI recommendations.
  - Set up Next.js with Tailwind CSS and deploy a basic smart contract on 0G testnet.
  - Build a mock AI model using 0G Compute and design a responsive UI prototype.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Detailed project plan and feature backlog.
  - Demo with static price data and mock AI insights.
  - Initial logo and branding reflecting 0G’s decentralized ethos.
